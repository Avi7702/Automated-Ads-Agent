## WHAT THIS APP DOES

Users upload boring product photos. They describe what they want in plain English. The app understands their intent dynamically and generates professional marketing visuals.

**No menus. No feature selection. Just natural conversation.**

The same simple flow handles everything:
- Lifestyle shots
- Installation/combination visuals
- Before/after transformations
- Scale demonstrations
- Seasonal campaigns
- Problem/solution visuals
- Product family shots
- Action/in-use shots
- Platform-optimized content
- And anything else the user can describe

## DYNAMIC INTENT ENGINE (THE BRAIN)

When user provides a description, the system analyzes it to determine:

### 1. CONTENT TYPE DETECTION

| User says... | System detects → |
|-------------|------------------|
| "premium" / "lifestyle" / "aspirational" / "amazing" | → Lifestyle Transformation |
| "together" / "combined" / "installed" / "connected" / "assembled" | → Installation/Combination |
| "before and after" / "transformation" / "result" / "vs" | → Before/After Visual |
| "how big" / "size" / "scale" / "compared to" / "next to person" | → Scale Demonstration |
| "christmas" / "summer" / "holiday" / "spring" / "winter" / "easter" | → Seasonal Styling |
| "problem" / "solves" / "without" / "broken vs fixed" | → Problem/Solution |
| "all products" / "range" / "collection" / "family" / "lineup" | → Product Family |
| "in use" / "action" / "using" / "being used" / "working with" | → Action/In-Use Shot |
| "for Instagram" / "for LinkedIn" / "social media" / "post" | → Platform-Optimized |
| "professional" / "worksite" / "construction" / "industrial" | → Industry Context |
| No clear match / ambiguous | → Ask ONE clarifying question |

### 2. SCENE/ENVIRONMENT DETECTION

| Keywords | Environment |
|----------|-------------|
| "backyard" / "garden" / "outdoor" / "park" / "nature" | Outdoor lifestyle |
| "home" / "kitchen" / "living room" / "bedroom" / "interior" | Domestic setting |
| "office" / "workspace" / "desk" / "corporate" | Professional office |
| "construction" / "worksite" / "building" / "site" | Construction/industrial |
| "studio" / "clean" / "minimal" / "white" | Studio product shot |
| "street" / "urban" / "city" / "downtown" | Urban environment |
| "luxury" / "premium" / "high-end" / "elegant" | Upscale setting |
| Not specified | Infer from product type via research |

### 3. MOOD/STYLE DETECTION

| Keywords | Visual Style |
|----------|-------------|
| "premium" / "luxury" / "elegant" / "sophisticated" | Dramatic lighting, clean composition |
| "cozy" / "warm" / "inviting" / "homey" | Soft lighting, warm tones |
| "professional" / "corporate" / "business" | Clean, neutral, trustworthy |
| "fun" / "vibrant" / "energetic" / "bold" | Bright colors, dynamic angles |
| "minimal" / "clean" / "simple" | Uncluttered, lots of negative space |
| "dramatic" / "epic" / "impressive" | Hero angles, powerful lighting |
| "authentic" / "real" / "natural" | Documentary style, candid feel |

### 4. PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION

| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Style Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Instagram Post | 1:1 or 4:5 | Scroll-stopping, vibrant |
| Instagram Story | 9:16 | Full screen, immediate impact |
| LinkedIn | 1.91:1 or 1:1 | Professional, trustworthy |
| Facebook | 1.91:1 or 1:1 | Engagement-focused |
| Twitter/X | 16:9 | Clean, quick read |
| General/Not specified | 1:1 | Universal, works everywhere |

### 5. MULTI-IMAGE LOGIC

| Number of Images | System Behavior |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 1 image | Transform/place into scene |
| 2 images | Combine, show relationship, or use one as reference |
| 3+ images | Product family, collection, or multi-element scene |
| Image + reference scene | Match product into provided scene style |

## SMART PRODUCT RESEARCH (CONDITIONAL)

Research is triggered ONLY when needed:

**DO research when:**
- Product type is unclear from image
- User asks about installation/combination (need to know HOW they work together)
- Industry-specific context needed
- User explicitly asks for accurate representation

**SKIP research when:**
- Simple lifestyle/background swap
- User provides clear context
- Speed is priority
- Seasonal/style changes only

### Research Query Structure

When research IS needed, use Google Search grounding to find:

```
For product identification:
→ "What is [visual description of product]"
→ "What is [product] used for"

For combination/installation:
→ "How to install [product A] with [product B]"
→ "How do [product A] and [product B] work together"

For industry context:
→ "[Product type] professional photography"
→ "[Product] in use on [industry] site"

For aspirational context:
→ "Premium [product category] marketing photography"
→ "Lifestyle [product] photography examples"
```

## PROMPT CONSTRUCTION ENGINE

Based on detected intent, build prompt dynamically:

### Base Structure

```
[SCENE PLACEMENT] + [ENVIRONMENT DETAILS] + [LIGHTING/MOOD] + 
[PRODUCT FOCUS] + [STYLE INSTRUCTIONS] + [TECHNICAL SPECS]
```

### Template by Content Type

**LIFESTYLE TRANSFORMATION:**

for comparison. The product's value is immediately obvious."
```

The product remains professional, the seasonal theme enhances not overwhelms."
```

**PROBLEM/SOLUTION:**
```

"Place [product] in an authentic [industry] professional setting. 
[Workers/context] in background, the product is hero but environment 
is realistic. [Time of day] lighting, [documentary/professional] style, 
aspirational but believable."
```

## CLARIFICATION HANDLING

When intent is ambiguous, ask ONE focused question:

```
User: "Make this better"

System: "I'd love to help! Quick question - what's the main goal?
        
        • 🏠 Lifestyle shot (show it in a beautiful setting)
        • 👷 Professional context (show it being used at work)  
        • 📱 Social media ready (optimized for a specific platform)
        
        Or just describe the vibe you're going for!"
```

Never ask more than one question. Never show a complex menu. Keep it conversational.

## ERROR HANDLING

### Rate Limit (429)
```
"High demand right now! ⏳

Your image is queued and will be ready in approximately 30 seconds.

[Cancel] [Wait]"
```
→ Implement exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s → 40s
→ Max 3 retries, then show "Try again in a few minutes"

### Generation Failed
```
"That one didn't work out. Let me try a slightly different approach...

[Trying again automatically...]"
```
→ Simplify prompt and retry once
→ If second attempt fails: "Let's try describing it differently"

### Model Unavailable
```
"The AI service is temporarily unavailable. 

Please try again in a few minutes. Your uploaded images are saved.

[Retry] [Save & Exit]"
```
→ NO fallback to other models. Wait or fail gracefully.

### Unclear Product
```
"I want to make sure I get this right!

Could you tell me briefly what this product is? 
(e.g., 'steel rebar for construction' or 'outdoor furniture')"
```

### No Image Uploaded
```
"Please upload at least one product image to get started! 📷"
```

### Too Many Images
```
"For best results, please select up to 6 images. 

Which ones are most important for this visual?"
```

## CAPTION & HASHTAG GENERATION

After image generation, automatically create:

### Caption Generation Rules
- Match the detected mood/platform
- Keep it concise (under 150 characters for Twitter, flexible for others)
- Include subtle call-to-action when appropriate
- Professional tone for LinkedIn, casual for Instagram
- Never cringey or over-promotional

### Hashtag Generation Rules
- 5-8 relevant hashtags
- Mix of: industry, product type, mood, platform-trending
- Avoid overused/spammy tags
- Match the professional level of the content

---

## SESSION MANAGEMENT

### Per Session Limits
```
- Track generation count per session
- After 15 generations: "You've created 15 images! Want to continue?"
- After 20 generations: "Consider downloading your favorites - 
                         session will reset soon"
- Store generated images temporarily (1 hour)
- Provide "Download All" option
```

### Image Storage
```
- Save generated images to temp storage
- Provide download links (1K standard, 2K, 4K options)
- Clear after session ends or 1 hour timeout
- No permanent storage (user downloads what they want)
```

## FUTURE ADDITIONS (NOT FOR NOW)

These features are planned but NOT included in V1:
- Video generation (Veo integration)
- Batch processing (multiple outputs at once)
- Brand kit / style consistency across generations
- Team collaboration features
- API access for programmatic use
- Template saving / favorites

Build the core experience first. Add these later.
