## 2. AI Marketing Strategies Researched

### 2.1 Core Strategy: AI Augments, Not Replaces

## 3. How AI Changes SEO & Landing Pages

### 3.1 AI Overviews Disrupting Traditional SEO

- **AI Overviews appear in 13.14% of all US desktop searches** (Semrush, March 2025, 200K+ SERPs analyzed)
- Traditional SEO is changing rapidly; brands must now optimize for AI search visibility
- Semrush introduced **AI Optimization (AIO)** as a new feature for monitoring LLM visibility

### 3.2 SEO Tool Recommendations

| Tool        | Cost        | ROI Timeline | Key Feature                           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Surfer SEO  | $89-299/mo  | 30-90 days   | On-page content scoring               |
| Semrush One | $139-499/mo | 30-90 days   | AIO for AI search visibility          |
| Clearscope  | Custom      | 60-90 days   | Semantic coverage, content monitoring |

### 3.3 Landing Page AI (Unbounce Smart Traffic)

- **25%+ conversion increase** documented with Smart Traffic AI
- AI automatically routes visitors to the page variant they're most likely to convert on
- Requires minimum 50 conversions/month for Smart Traffic learning
- $99-649/mo pricing based on domains and conversion volume

### 3.4 Content Quality vs. Volume

The research strongly warns against content flooding:

- Google may penalize AI-generated spam
- Quality over quantity always wins
- AI should create first drafts, not final versions
- Human insights must be added to every piece
- Brand voice training is essential (3-5 content samples)

## 4. AI-First Marketing Insights

### 4.1 What the User Learned

**The Biggest Untapped Opportunity:**
Workflow automation (Zapier, Make, n8n) — only 6% of marketers use it despite $47K/year savings per team and 18.7 hours/week saved per marketer.

**What AI Excels At:**

- Research and ideation
- Creating first drafts quickly
- Generating variations for testing
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Analyzing data and patterns
- Personalizing at scale

**What AI Should NOT Be Used For:**

- Replacing human creativity and strategy
- Publishing without human review
- Complex decisions requiring judgment
- Authentic relationship building
- Creating thought leadership

**Critical Warning from Neil Patel:**

> "Marketers are using AI for the wrong things. They're using it on stuff that aren't necessarily producing ROI."

## 5. LLM Citations & AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

### 5.1 AI Overviews & LLM Visibility

The research identifies a paradigm shift in SEO toward optimizing for AI-generated answers:

- **13.14% of US desktop searches** now show AI Overviews (Semrush, March 2025)
- Semrush introduced **AI Optimization (AIO)** feature to track visibility in AI search results
- This is categorized as a "new metric for 2025" — brands need to monitor presence in AI Overviews
- Traditional SEO strategies must now account for how LLMs cite and surface content

### 5.2 AEO Implications from the Research

While the term "AEO" (Answer Engine Optimization) is not explicitly used in the documents, the research clearly addresses the concept:

1. **Content must be structured for AI consumption** — AI Overviews pull from well-structured, authoritative content
2. **Semantic coverage matters more than keyword density** — tools like Clearscope and Surfer SEO focus on comprehensive topic coverage that LLMs favor
3. **Semrush AIO feature** — specifically designed to track how often a brand appears in AI-generated search results
4. **Privacy & AI search impact** — traditional cookie-based targeting is being replaced by behavioral and AI-driven methods
5. **Content quality is the new moat** — human-written, expert content gets cited more by AI than generic AI-generated content

### 5.3 Key AEO-Related Statistics

- 65% of companies report better SEO results with AI tools (2025)
- AI Overviews impact is growing and measurable via Semrush AIO
- Businesses optimizing for AI search visibility represent a new competitive frontier
- The research recommends monitoring "AI Overview presence" as a KPI

## 7. Client Recommendation Framework (Internal)

The internal guide includes a structured discovery process:

**Discovery Questions:**
