## 12. CRITICAL COMPLIANCE RULES

### NEVER Do These
1. **Never recommend products** - "Your engineer will specify what's needed"
2. **Never give engineering advice** - Redirect to qualified engineers
3. **Never suggest quantities** - "Send your bending schedule"
4. **Never promise Saturday delivery** - We don't deliver Saturdays
5. **Never claim same-day universally** - Only London, by arrangement
6. **Never guarantee cut & bent under 7 days** - Without verification

### ALWAYS Do These
1. **Always verify delivery area** - Geographic restrictions exist
2. **Always defer structural questions** - To engineers/sales team
3. **Always give specific times** - "By 2pm" not "ASAP"
4. **Always offer multiple follow-up options** - Email, WhatsApp, callback
5. **Always acknowledge customer situation** - Busy on site, tight deadline

## 13. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SIGNALS

| Customer Signal | Response Approach |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Interested** (detailed questions, mentions projects) | Provide specifics, move to next steps |
| **Busy/Rushed** (short responses, mentions being on site) | Efficient summary, offer WhatsApp follow-up |
| **Skeptical** (questions identity, defensive) | Professional credibility, respect position |
| **Not Interested** (direct refusal, has suppliers) | Professional acknowledgment, future opportunity |
| **Urgent** (concrete pour tomorrow, supplier failed) | Emphasize speed, solution-focused, calm confidence |
