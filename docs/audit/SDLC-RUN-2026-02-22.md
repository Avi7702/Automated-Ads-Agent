# SDLC Full-Project Run Report

- Date: `2026-02-22 15:47:34 +00:00`
- Commit baseline: `5d866f0`
- Scope: full repository gate run per universal SDLC plan

## Commands Executed

1. `npm run check`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm test`
4. `npm run build`

## Gate Results

- `check` (TypeScript): PASS
- `lint` (ESLint `--max-warnings 0`): FAIL
  - Result: `1055 warnings`, `0 errors`
  - Primary blocker: strict warning budget (`max-warnings 0`) on a repo with existing warnings (including `.tmp-agentic-ads-agent-cf-*` and legacy files).
- `test` (Vitest): FAIL
  - Result: `2 failed files`, `14 failed tests`, `1298 passed`
  - Failed files:
    - `client/src/__tests__/integration/studio.test.tsx`
    - `client/src/pages/__tests__/Studio-integration.test.tsx`
  - Main failure pattern:
    - tests still expect old upload UI element `data-testid="add-upload-btn"` after recent Studio/Agent UX restructuring.
- `build` (Vite + esbuild): PASS

## Release Decision

- Decision: `NO-GO`
- Hard gate trigger(s):
  - failing `lint` gate
  - failing `test` gate

## Blockers To Clear

1. Align integration tests to current Studio layout and chat-first flow:
   - remove assumptions about old upload panel controls
   - re-target tests to current flow and selectors
2. Decide lint policy for migration period:
   - either reduce warning debt to zero, or
   - scope lint to active app paths and exclude temporary snapshots, then enforce zero warnings there
3. Re-run full gates after steps 1-2:
   - `npm run check && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`

## Notes

- Build artifacts are healthy; runtime packaging succeeds.
- Type safety is currently green after fixes in:
  - `client/src/components/ideabank/IdeaBankPanel.tsx`
  - `server/routes.ts`
