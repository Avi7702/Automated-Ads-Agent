## 2. Customer Needs Identified

### 2.1 Trust & Legitimacy Verification (CRITICAL — #1 Need)

- **FCA authorization display**: Customers actively verify FRN numbers on FCA register
- **Review volume**: 100+ Trustpilot reviews minimum for credibility (competitors have 1,000-10,000+)

- **Physical presence**: Office address, local ties (Manchester positioning)
- **Media coverage**: BBC, Guardian, FT mentions provide instant credibility
- **Industry memberships**: Professional body affiliations signal legitimacy
- **Why critical**: CMC industry has severe trust deficit; consumers equate claims companies with scammers

### 2.2 Risk Elimination

- **No win, no fee guarantee**: Non-negotiable for customer acquisition
- **No upfront costs**: Any upfront fee request triggers immediate abandonment
- **Clear fee caps**: FCA-mandated caps (15-30% depending on claim type) must be prominently displayed

- **Reassurance**: "We've helped thousands in your exact situation"
- **Sensitivity**: Understanding trauma around financial loss, especially retirement savings
- **Confidentiality**: Assurance that personal/financial details are secure

### 2.8 Education & Awareness

- **Understanding rights**: Many consumers don't know they have grounds for a claim
