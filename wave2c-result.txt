Wave 2C — Remove Dead /api/estimate-cost Call
===============================================

Status: COMPLETED

File Modified:
  client/src/components/studio/SmartCanvas/sections/GenerateButton.tsx

Changes Made:
1. Removed `useState` and `useEffect` imports (no longer needed)
2. Removed `PriceEstimate` interface (lines 8-13)
3. Removed `priceEstimate` state variable (useState<PriceEstimate | null>)
4. Removed entire useEffect block that fetched `/api/estimate-cost` (POST request that silently failed every time since the endpoint doesn't exist on the server)
5. Replaced dynamic price estimate display (`Est. $X.XXX`) with static text "Credits deducted after generation"
6. Updated JSDoc comment from "Main generation trigger with price estimate" to "Main generation trigger"
7. Updated inline comment from "Price estimate and info" to "Image count and info"

What Was Preserved:
- Generate button functionality (fully intact)
- Image count display ("N images selected")
- All generation mutation logic (POST /api/transform)
- All imports still needed (useMutation, useQueryClient, useStudioState, Button, icons, getProductImageUrl)

Build Verification:
- TypeScript syntax parse: PASSED
- `npx vite build`: PASSED (built in 7m 13s, 3352 modules transformed)

Commit: fix: remove dead /api/estimate-cost call from GenerateButton
