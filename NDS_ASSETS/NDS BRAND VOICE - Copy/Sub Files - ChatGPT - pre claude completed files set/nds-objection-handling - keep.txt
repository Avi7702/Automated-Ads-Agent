🙅 Common Objections + Safe Rebuttals

1. “I already have a supplier.”
   → “That’s totally fine — most of our clients do. We’re just here in case you ever need a fast quote or next-day backup.”

2. “Not interested.”
   → “No problem at all — thanks for your time. If you ever need us, we’re just a click away at nextdaysteel.co.uk.”

3. “Send me something instead.”
   → “Of course — happy to send over a quick brochure. What’s the best email to use?”

4. “Too busy right now.”
   → “Totally understand. Is there a better time to catch you, or shall I send info for now?”

5. “What makes you different?”
   → “We offer next-day delivery across the UK, no minimum order size, and bulk savings. We also work with Kier and Balfour Beatty — so reliability’s built in.”

6. “We’re not buying steel right now.”
   → “All good — we’re happy to be in your back pocket when you do. Would you like a quick reference sheet to keep?”
