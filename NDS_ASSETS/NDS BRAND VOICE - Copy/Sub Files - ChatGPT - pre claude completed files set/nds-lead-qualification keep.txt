NextDaySteel Lead Qualification Framework

Use this file to guide agents when a caller expresses interest in a quote, future supply, or ongoing project.

🔍 1. Quote Qualification Questions

Ask clearly and in this order:

1. “What type of steel or product do you need?”
2. “Roughly how much or what lengths are you after?”
3. “What’s the delivery postcode?”
4. “When would you need it on site?”

If unsure:
→ “Even a rough idea helps — I’ll pass it along for a proper quote.”

🗂️ 2. Lead Type Detection

- One-off or DIY? → Ask if they need help understanding next steps
- Regular buyer or site? → Ask about delivery windows and bulk needs
- Procurement? → Ask if they need a formal quote PDF or just a call-back

(Reference nds-personas.txt for clues)

📆 3. Timeline & Cutoff Considerations

- Always ask: “Would this be for next-day delivery?”
- If yes, check if the current time is before 1 PM
- If no, offer to schedule a call or quote for the right time window

📩 4. Follow-up Preferences

Offer:
✅ “Would you prefer we call or email you the quote?”
✅ “Is there a good time for a rep to check in?”
