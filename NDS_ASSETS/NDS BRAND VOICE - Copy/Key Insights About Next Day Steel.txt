Before finalizing my recommendations, I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions:

What is the current perception of NDS among customers? Do you have any testimonials or recurring feedback that highlights what customers most appreciate?

Are there specific industry terms or language preferences that resonate better with your audience?

Who are your main competitors and how would you describe their brand voice? What aspects would you like to differentiate from?

Are there any upcoming service expansions or improvements that should be reflected in the brand voice?

What tone has worked best in previous communications - more professional/technical or more conversational/accessible?
