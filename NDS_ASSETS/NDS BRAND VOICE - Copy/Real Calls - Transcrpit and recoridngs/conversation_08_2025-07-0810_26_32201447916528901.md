**[00:00 - 00:06]** Hello, there's Anton. I've just seen you order on our website. Apologies, but we don't actually

**[00:06 - 00:12]** stock any steel beams in our block. No, if it's real nice, I'm going to have to come

**[00:12 - 00:17]** through order on the road. You don't stock any of them. We stock reinforcements deal,

**[00:17 - 00:22]** but we still don't keep on the ground. We work with specialist fabricated partners,

**[00:22 - 00:27]** but we don't hold it on the ground. So yeah, I'm going to have to come through order on

**[00:27 - 00:36]** that one. Oh, all right. No point. I'll get that cancelled. You don't have anything

**[00:36 - 00:44]** like that even lying about. It was just a sample really. Not not structural. No. Re-enforcement

**[00:44 - 00:53]** we do, but not reinforce not structural. We work with different partners and stuff.

**[00:53 - 00:58]** What do you mean when you say structural? As in steel beams, we don't stock steel beams

**[00:58 - 01:07]** in our yard. We do the metal we bar and the metal we work with specialist partners

**[01:07 - 01:15]** to bring in. Okay, all right, mate. No problem. Sorry about that. I'll get it refunded

**[01:15 - 01:19]** if I'm decently not a problem. No problem. It's fine. It's fine. Bye bye.
