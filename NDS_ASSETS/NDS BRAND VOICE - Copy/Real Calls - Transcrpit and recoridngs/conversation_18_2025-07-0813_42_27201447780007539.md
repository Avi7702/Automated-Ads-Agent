**[00:00 - 00:01]** Hello.

**[00:01 - 00:04]** I'm speaking from a must start from the MSC construction.

**[00:04 - 00:06]** Yeah, you are, yes, I am.

**[00:06 - 00:07]** Much that high.

**[00:07 - 00:09]** This is getting caught in from next base field.

**[00:09 - 00:10]** I don't know.

**[00:10 - 00:17]** Yes, we spoke from previously because you ordered a couple of Ben jobs towards for sighting

**[00:17 - 00:18]** F2B5.

**[00:18 - 00:19]** Yes, yeah, you did.

**[00:19 - 00:20]** You got to do one for me.

**[00:20 - 00:24]** Yeah, I know you, Pizzcave orders, so we appreciate that.

**[00:24 - 00:27]** And just so I get back into it, so it's not out from you since then to see how you get

**[00:27 - 00:30]** all in there if you got any kind of further reinforcements to do with our management,

**[00:30 - 00:32]** we could be able to help you with, you know, a necessary markup and then...

**[00:32 - 00:33]** Sure.

**[00:33 - 00:34]** We might have a...

**[00:34 - 00:39]** Yeah, we'll find a new project in September over time, so we need reinforcements for

**[00:39 - 00:40]** the basement.

**[00:40 - 00:45]** But we're not ready yet, so like I say, it's probably been walked over to September all

**[00:45 - 00:46]** being well.

**[00:46 - 00:50]** It might be pushing to make sure that's our next project, so I've got your details, so

**[00:50 - 00:52]** yeah, I'll give you a shout-out when we're ready.

**[00:52 - 00:53]** Effect.

**[00:53 - 00:55]** I'll put a note on my system also.

**[00:55 - 01:00]** So what I'll do is I'll drop any moment details if you've got them, and then when you're

**[01:00 - 01:03]** ready, you can let me know, and I'm just going to have to go on price and leave time

**[01:03 - 01:04]** that way.

**[01:04 - 01:05]** Okay, thanks for all that.

**[01:05 - 01:06]** Thanks for all that.

**[01:06 - 01:10]** Just let you know, we also now supply Trent Sheet and a variety of call-it products, if

**[01:10 - 01:15]** you need any, like, Trent Sheet, or he gone, or whatever it may be, we can provide you

**[01:15 - 01:19]** a good price to those, but then I send you any more details, and while we try to just

**[01:19 - 01:22]** have some holidays and I'm going to go from there.

**[01:22 - 01:23]** Okay, perfect.

**[01:23 - 01:24]** Thank you.

**[01:24 - 01:25]** Thank you.
