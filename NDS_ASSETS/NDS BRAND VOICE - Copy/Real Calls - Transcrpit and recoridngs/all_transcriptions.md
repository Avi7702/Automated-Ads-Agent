**[00:12 - 00:15]** Well, we'll get everything ready for the VSOP.

**[00:15 - 00:22]** No, we're not. I'll just click still checking with someone because I don't know whether to put the second layer of mess.

**[00:22 - 00:25]** So then I'll mine up the a three nine four.

**[00:25 - 00:27]** Sure. So if yes, right.

**[00:27 - 00:31]** You can always pay for it and then we can just add that add it on to the order.

**[00:31 - 00:32]** Make a payment.

**[00:32 - 00:34]** No, not problems. Either way, we can.

**[00:34 - 00:36]** The source is not a problem.

**[00:36 - 00:37]** Okay, then I'll pay for it now.

**[00:37 - 00:39]** And then if I need to add it, I don't think I will add it.

**[00:39 - 00:41]** But I'm just going to double check someone else.

**[00:41 - 00:46]** Yeah, we'll try for one layer, but I'm sort of in pinching and going to go.

**[00:46 - 00:49]** Perfect. Yeah, you know that's not what you're doing anyway.

**[00:49 - 00:52]** So it's not that truth needs to be perfect. Thank you.

**[00:53 - 00:54]** Cheers. Thank you.

**[01:01 - 01:05]** then any treat or any kind of heat guard, so called product food as well.

**[01:05 - 01:10]** But I can go to an email and I hope to hear from you and this month or next month with

**[01:10 - 01:11]** your requirement.

**[01:11 - 01:12]** Perfect.

**[00:07 - 00:08]** Nick, good afternoon.

**[00:08 - 00:12]** My name is Gideon from a company called Nexus Feel.

**[00:12 - 00:17]** I don't know if you remember, but back in October 2023,

**[00:17 - 00:20]** you placed a couple of orders for a couple of people.

**[00:20 - 00:22]** You placed an order with us for some A142 mess,

**[00:22 - 00:25]** which we delivered to a site in Manor Road in South Winster.

**[00:25 - 00:27]** Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll pay for it.

**[00:27 - 00:29]** I had a fair deal with you tonight.

**[00:29 - 00:31]** It was a great pleasure to meet you here last and one year.

**[00:31 - 00:34]** The reason why I call Nick is that we might have

**[00:34 - 00:36]** on me since it all decided to start getting touched

**[00:36 - 00:37]** just to kind of say hello again,

**[00:37 - 00:39]** and see if you've got any further reinforcements

**[00:39 - 00:40]** to deal with climate.

**[00:40 - 00:41]** You could be really helped with your weather,

**[00:41 - 00:43]** whether we've got some more mastery, barker,

**[00:43 - 00:44]** and bend accessories,

**[00:44 - 00:46]** so on and so forth, basically.

**[00:46 - 00:48]** Yeah, I've got quite a few jobs actually.

**[00:48 - 00:52]** What is your A142 working out as she?

**[00:52 - 00:55]** And what size A142 looking for?

**[00:55 - 00:58]** 6.4x1.2s.

**[00:58 - 01:01]** They would be, well, the price was very on the quantity,

**[01:01 - 01:03]** but once it's 8.89,

**[01:03 - 01:06]** obviously the more sheets you order,

**[01:06 - 01:09]** the price might drop thing on the quantity.

**[01:09 - 01:12]** Right, because we're getting quite a good deal on that,

**[01:12 - 01:13]** the man.

**[01:13 - 01:16]** I can't even feel just framed or it's not framed.

**[01:16 - 01:18]** It's not, it's not creating,

**[01:18 - 01:20]** but I'll help you offload it.

**[01:20 - 01:21]** It's just taking you back anyway,

**[01:21 - 01:22]** so are you worth it?

**[01:22 - 01:24]** It's not a tie-out drive could do it themselves,

**[01:24 - 01:26]** because it's like, you know,

**[01:26 - 01:28]** six and a half kilos of sheets.

**[01:28 - 01:30]** If you guys get anything,

**[01:30 - 01:32]** if it's not trained like that,

**[01:32 - 01:34]** we tend to use more of it,

**[01:34 - 01:36]** because it doesn't overlap very well.

**[01:36 - 01:38]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[01:38 - 01:40]** I have that, that is the other thing.

**[01:40 - 01:44]** I've got an invoice of what I'm paying for it at the moment,

**[01:44 - 01:49]** in my class, of course, actually.

**[01:49 - 01:54]** Of course, all the included in the A14.

**[01:54 - 01:56]** Plus the A14.

**[01:56 - 01:58]** Plus the A14.

**[01:58 - 02:00]** Right.

**[02:00 - 02:02]** So, including the A14,

**[02:02 - 02:04]** 1295.

**[02:04 - 02:06]** I'm paying that from the Sun.

**[02:06 - 02:08]** And that's the value of the Sun.

**[02:08 - 02:10]** So, I'm trying to spark and spread it.

**[02:10 - 02:12]** The two won't hold my 1.2 size mesh.

**[02:12 - 02:14]** Yes, and they're strong.

**[02:14 - 02:16]** Wow, I don't know, that's a good price.

**[02:16 - 02:18]** Do you have anything else?

**[02:18 - 02:20]** Because, you know,

**[02:20 - 02:22]** there might be some meshers out on get

**[02:22 - 02:26]** from the birthmatch, and that we can apply for.

**[02:26 - 02:28]** Paisley, we use the A14.

**[02:28 - 02:30]** We use the Linux,

**[02:30 - 02:32]** we store it in every patio,

**[02:32 - 02:34]** and some of the most of our patioes are over 100 meters.

**[02:34 - 02:36]** Great.

**[02:36 - 02:38]** We're making quite a lot of it.

**[02:38 - 02:40]** And that's probably the reason

**[02:40 - 02:42]** being a relative in service proteins,

**[02:42 - 02:44]** we get a good deal.

**[02:44 - 02:46]** Well, look, I'm sure

**[02:46 - 02:48]** we can do something.

**[02:48 - 02:50]** I'm sure my boss would love to work with you.

**[02:50 - 02:52]** I'm sure I can ask a question.

**[02:52 - 02:54]** So, I think what's best,

**[02:54 - 02:56]** is your next inquiry, just send it over to me

**[02:56 - 02:58]** and just make it know of what price you've got

**[02:58 - 03:00]** on the last bit of director.

**[03:00 - 03:02]** And see if anything we can do, and that's come sure.

**[03:02 - 03:04]** I'm sure my boss would love to do something

**[03:04 - 03:06]** to get you order from one of the builders in the industry.

**[03:06 - 03:10]** So, I think it's always best to just send your next inquiry over to me

**[03:10 - 03:12]** and we can see if it can make it work price-wise for you.

**[03:12 - 03:14]** Yes, sure. I can probably say

**[03:14 - 03:16]** you won't know how to do this later.

**[03:16 - 03:18]** We're going to be starting.

**[03:18 - 03:20]** You know, at least if you get a quote from us,

**[03:20 - 03:22]** you know, for sure you get the best rates.

**[03:22 - 03:24]** But, yeah, I'm pretty sure my boss

**[03:24 - 03:26]** would want to do something for you.
