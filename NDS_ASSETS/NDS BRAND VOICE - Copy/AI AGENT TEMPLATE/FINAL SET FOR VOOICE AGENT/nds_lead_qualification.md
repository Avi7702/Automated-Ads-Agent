🔍 LEAD TYPE DETECTION

🗂️ Customer Classification (Reference nds-personas.txt):

→ Ask if they need help understanding next steps
→ Offer technical team consultation

🏢 Regular buyer or site?
→ Ask about delivery windows and bulk needs
→ Focus on ongoing relationship potential

📋 Procurement?
→ Ask if they need formal quote PDF or just callback
→ Emphasize documentation and professional process

🔨 Site foreman/tradesperson?

📍 DELIVERY VERIFICATION PROCESS

⚠️ Address Verification (CRITICAL):
"What's your delivery address? I need to verify we can deliver there as some products cannot be delivered to all parts of the country."

🗺️ Coverage Check:
- Mainland UK: Next-day delivery available
- Islands: 2-3 days via ferry connection  
- London area: Same-day delivery within 30 miles
- Remote areas: May require special arrangements

🔍 When Address Issues:
"Let me check our delivery options for your location and have our logistics team confirm the best arrangement for you."

⏰ TIMELINE & CUTOFF CONSIDERATIONS

📅 Delivery Timing:
- Always ask: "Would this be for next-day delivery?"

⏱️ Cutoff Awareness:
