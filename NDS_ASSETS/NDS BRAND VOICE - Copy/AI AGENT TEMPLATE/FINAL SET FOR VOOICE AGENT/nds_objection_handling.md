3. POSITION: "We find many customers use us for backup or emergency situations"
4. CLOSE: "Can I send you our contact details for urgent situations?"

💬 Full Script:
"That's great to hear you have a good relationship with your current supplier. What do you value most about working with them? We find many customers use us for backup or emergency situations when their regular supplier can't deliver urgently.

2. FUTURE FOCUS: "When do you typically plan your next projects?"
3. VALUE: "Many customers like having our details for when urgent needs arise"
4. FOLLOW-UP: "Would it be worth calling you back in [timeframe]?"

💬 Full Script:
"I understand - not every call comes at the right time. When do you typically plan your next projects? Many customers like having our details for when urgent needs arise. If I call you back in 2-3 months time, would you have a job needing steel? When roughly is your next steel project?"

4. RESPECT: "Would you prefer I remove you from our contact list?"

💬 Full Script:
"We're contacting construction companies in your area about steel reinforcement materials. I wanted to see if you ever need materials like rebar or mesh for your projects. If this isn't relevant to your business, I'm happy to remove you from our contact list. Would you prefer that?"

🧠 ADVANCED OBJECTION HANDLING

💰 "YOUR PRICES ARE TOO HIGH":
"I understand price is important. We focus on total value - reliable delivery, professional service, and beating written quotes from competitors. Our sales team can work with you on competitive pricing. What pricing would make this worthwhile for you to consider?"

📋 "WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS":
"Contracts are important for planning. Even with contracts, most companies need backup suppliers for urgent situations or when their main supplier has issues. Worth having our details for those emergency situations when you need steel delivered next day."

📞 "WE DON'T TAKE COLD CALLS":
"I understand and respect that policy. Since we specialize in emergency steel delivery, would it be worth having our contact details for genuine urgent situations? You never know when you might need steel delivered next day unexpectedly."
